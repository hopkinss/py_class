Assignments and Readings
===========================
Prior to class, you should have at least familiarized yourself with the readings for that lesson. |br|
The lesson activities should be completed prior to the start of the next lesson. Time permitting, we will discuss the activities prior to the end of class. |br|
Once the class has Github accounts, the users can post assignments to their Github for code review or to collaborate with peers. The instructor solutions for the
activities will be posted to a repo in one of the instructors Github accounts in case you need some guidance.

Lesson 01
----------------------
Reading
+++++++++++++
Get Mu installed before you do anything. Use Python 3 *Create code using standard Python 3*. You can write code in the editor, save the file (make a local folder named 'lesson01') and click run.
Be sure to click 'Stop' before trying to edit the code again. Another alternative is to use the REPL Python shell in the command bar. This allows you to interactively execute code and observe
the outcome interactively. With Mu open, click |repl| icon to invoke the REPL for live coding. Submit code interactively and observe the values...

Activities
+++++++++++++
**Warmup** Go to `CodingBat code practice <https://codingbat.com/python/>`_ . Select some excercises from the following:

    * String 2
    * List - 1
    * Logic -1


.. code-block:: Python
   :caption: Activity 1 - Console input/output

    Create a script that uses the console to capture some required demographic data about a subject(e.g. id, sex, age, race, ect..). When you have all the information fore a subject, display the
    data on the console in a nicely formatted presentation.

    * add some validation to ensure the input is acceptable (e.g. no strings for age, no missing values for sex)
    * take some action if the user fails to reply properly after 3 prompts for correct input

.. code-block:: Python
   :caption: Activity 2 - Fizz Buzz

    Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 inclusive.

    * But for multiples of three print **Fizz** instead of the number.
    * For the multiples of five print**Buzz** instead of the number.
    * For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print **FizzBuzz** instead.
