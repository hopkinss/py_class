Configure your system
==================================

Required for 1st class
------------------------
    #. Have a Windows laptop  - eventually you will want to have local admin privs (i can help if you can't), but this is not necessary to start
    #. Download and install `Mu <https://codewith.mu/en/download>`_ for Windows 64-bit. It will be our integrated development environment (IDE) for at least two lessons. 
        
        .. note::
            `Mu` should install without admin privileges and contains its own Python installation, so there are no other dependencies.

Recommended 
----------------------

    #. Download and install Git Bash for Windows `git <http://www.techoism.com/how-to-install-git-bash-on-windows/>`_
    #. Create a GitHub account and make a py01 repository `github <https://github.com/join?source=experiment-header-dropdowns-home/>`_            

You'll need admin for this so hold off until we are ready 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
    #. Download and install the latest version of Python for Windows (3.7.0) if you dont already have 3.6 or higher `python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_
    #. Download and install PyCharm Community Edition - IDE for later in course `PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows/>`_
