Assignments and Readings
===========================
Prior to class, you should have at least familiarized yourself with the readings for that lesson. |br|
The lesson activities should be completed prior to the start of the next lesson. Time permitting, we will discuss the activities prior to the end of class. |br|
Once the class has Github accounts, the users can post assignments to their Github for code review or to collaborate with peers. The instructor solutions for the
activities will be posted to a repo in one of the instructors Github accounts in case you need some guidance.

Lesson 01
----------------------
Preparation
+++++++++++++
Get Mu installed before you do anything. Use Python 3 *Create code using standard Python 3*. You can write code in the editor, save the file (make a local folder named 'lesson01') and click run.
Be sure to click 'Stop' before trying to edit the code again. Another alternative is to use the REPL Python shell in the command bar. This allows you to interactively execute code and observe
the outcome interactively. With Mu open, click |repl| icon to invoke the REPL for live coding. Submit code interactively and observe the values...

 Readings
 +++++++++++++++++++++++

`Introduction <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html>`__
`Flow Control <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html>`__

**Warmup** Go to `CodingBat code practice <https://codingbat.com/python/>`_ . Select some excercises from the following and execute them in th e REPL:

    * String 2
    * List - 1
    * Logic -1


Activities
+++++++++++++
Complete the exercises and push the solutions to your Github :). Be as creative as you want as these are not requirements, just a guide to get you started.


.. code-block:: Python
   :caption: Fizz Buzz

    Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 inclusive.

    1) For multiples of three print **Fizz** instead of the number.
    2) For the multiples of five print**Buzz** instead of the number.
    3) For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print **FizzBuzz** instead.

.. code-block:: Python
    :caption: Number adder

    Create a program that prompts the user for 2 numbers. Display the sum back to the user 

    * Optionally prompt the user for the operand
    * Create an interesting format for the response

.. code-block:: Python
    :caption: Statistics on lists of numbers

    Create a program that allows the user to enter as many numbers as they want until the user types **Q**. (see WHILE loop with BREAK). When the user enters **Q**,
     display some statistics about the list. 

     * Optionally read how to import the statistics module into your program and use its methods to calculate statistics


.. code-block:: Python
   :caption: Store data in a dictionary

    Create a script that uses the console to capture some required demographic data about a subject(e.g. id, sex, age, race, ect..). Store the data in a dictionary.If the user types **print** 
    then print the contents of the dictionary.

    * add some validation to ensure the input is acceptable (e.g. no strings for age, no missing values for sex)
    * take some action if the user fails to reply properly after 3 prompts for correct input

.. code-block:: Python
    :caption: Random number guesser

    Create a program that 
        1) Defines a random number - you will need to import random, see starter code below 
        2) Continue to ask the user to input an integer until the value is correct 
        3) If the user guesses the correct answer, print a congratulations message and leave the loop
        4) Allow the user to leave the loop anytime by typing **Q**
        
        * Extra - display the number of guesses it took the user to arrive at the correct number
